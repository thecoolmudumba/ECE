Hello! Welcome to the Laboratory section of this course!

Here, you can find my lab assignments for this course using ESP32-WROOM-32E Microcontroller Board. A quick summary of the Lab assignments is provided below:

LAB 1: Exercising Peripherals (Interrupts, Timers, RTC, GPIO, PWM): This assignment deals with 3 different peripherals, namely GPIO, PWM, and the RTC on the 
    ESP32 Feather Board. In addition to these peripherals, we use timers and 
    interrupts to implement LED control and a switch.
